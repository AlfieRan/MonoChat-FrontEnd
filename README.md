# MonoChat

This was the first fullstack web project I built completely by myself, hence why it's a bit bad.

If you were to clone the relevant repositories, set it all up and run it then it should theoretically work but I am also pretty sure I was midway through changing how the chats worked so that may not be true.

Tech used:
 - Typescript
 - React
 - Next.js
 - Express API
 - PostgreSQL
 - Prisma js
 
 If you want to attempt to make this work for your own enjoyment, feel free but also good luck because a lot of the code is pretty rushed ðŸ˜¬
